# Backend Service for Recipe Platform

This project operates the main API interface between the frontend of the operation and the database. Additionally, it integrates the twilio support for the application, with future plans to handle the email handling as well. The project is split into to main folders: `api_service` and `input_service`.

## api_service

This module handles the API calls made by the `Vue` App. Created using the `flask-restful` package.

## input_service

Will handle twilio/email integrations. Future plans for as many integrations as possible.
